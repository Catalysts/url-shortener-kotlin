# url-shortener-kotlin
Url Shortener with Kotlin, Spring Boot and Redis

This implementation is inspired by https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2014/08/url-shortener-service-in-42-lines-of-code-in-java-spring-boot-redis.html, and takes usaage of the great integration of Kotlin with Spring Boot, therefore we can even reduce the number of lines of code again.
